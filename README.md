# Secure-Medical-Record-System
Secure, consent-based medical record management system with JWT authentication and hybrid post-quantum encryption (Kyber + AES-GCM).

🔐 Secure Medical Records System

A full-stack, consent-driven medical records management platform designed to ensure strong data confidentiality, integrity, and controlled access using modern cryptographic techniques and policy-based authorization.

📌 Overview

The Secure Medical Records System is built to protect sensitive patient health data through:

JWT-based authentication

Role-based access control (Doctor / Patient)

Consent-based authorization model (Policy Decision Point - PDP)

Hybrid post-quantum encryption (Kyber + AES-GCM)

Secure encrypted file storage

This system ensures that medical records can only be accessed when valid consent is granted, enforcing strict privacy and compliance principles.

🏗 System Architecture

The system follows a layered security model:

Authentication Layer

JWT-based token authentication using SimpleJWT

Role distinction between Doctors and Patients

Authorization Layer

Policy Decision Point (PDP) verifies active consent

Access allowed only if valid consent exists

Encryption Layer

Hybrid Encryption Model

Kyber (Post-Quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanism)

AES-GCM for symmetric encryption

Secure storage of encrypted medical files

Database Layer

MySQL for structured record management

🛠 Tech Stack
Backend

Django

Django REST Framework

SimpleJWT

MySQL

Frontend

React

Axios

Security & Cryptography

Kyber (Post-Quantum Cryptography)

AES-GCM (Authenticated Encryption)

🚀 Key Features

Patient Registration & Login

Doctor Authentication

Consent Grant & Revoke System

Secure Medical Record Upload

Encrypted File Storage

Policy-Based Access Control

JWT Token Management

Hybrid Post-Quantum Encryption

🔐 Security Model

This project implements a hybrid encryption mechanism:

Kyber is used to securely exchange symmetric keys.

AES-GCM encrypts medical files using the derived symmetric key.

Encrypted data is stored in the database.

Decryption occurs only after successful consent validation.

This ensures:

Confidentiality of medical data

Integrity through authenticated encryption

Future readiness against quantum attacks

# Secure Patient Health Record Storage

## Problem
Healthcare records contain sensitive data and must be stored securely.

## Solution
This project implements encryption-based secure storage for patient records.

## Features
- AES based file encryption
- Secure file storage
- Decryption for authorized access

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Cryptography libraries
- Django
- react js
- sql
  
## Work
- Post-quantum encryption integration
- Secure key exchange
- Web interface for patient access
- quick encryption and decryption

## Future works
- will make it really easy for patients so that only they need togive a key for doctor rather doctor even registering in the applicatin
- will try to make analytics on the encrypted data
